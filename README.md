# Divvy-Ridership

Using Divvy ridership data from 2014-2017, our group collaboratively used Tableau to seek new insights that could be used to improve Divvy's performance in future years. The presentation attached includes all of our collective Tableau visualizations. Some of the data proved to be far too large, making it difficult to upload directly to GitHub. Please ask if you would like to know more.
